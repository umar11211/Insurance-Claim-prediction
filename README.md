# Insurance-Claim-prediction

Problem Statement
Task 1:-Create a predictive model which will help the insurance marketing team to know which customer will buy the product.

Conclusion: This dataset does not contain any Column Names, so we don't have any visibility on what column is what type of data. Therefore we tried direct modelling with ANN and Logistic Regression and the accuracy is 96%. We can use either of the above model as it is giving the same accuracy.
